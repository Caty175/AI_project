This project develops a linear regression model to predict office prices based on office size using a dataset. It utilizes gradient descent for optimization and normalizes the data for improved performance. The model is trained to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) and can predict prices for specified office sizes, showcasing its application in real estate analysis.
